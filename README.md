Testing, is this change going to show up?



Mon, Nov. 15th - Finally have the time to get to work and get started on this project.  Made sure every file was working properly and started working on the main code file.

Tuesday, Nov. 16th - After struggling for a while within visual studio code, I've moved over to Atom.  For some reason, visual studio code won't import PySimpleGUI, which is what I was hoping to make my user interface with.  Did find a workaround that worked on windows but not on Mac.

Wednesday, Nov. 17th - Mainly spent my time learning more about PySimpleGUI, figuring out how exactly I can use this as my framework for the project.
