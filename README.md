# YahtzeeScoreCounter Steven Lukehart
 This program will be used to track multiple people's scores in an in person yahtzee game

Testing, is this change going to show up?



Mon, Nov. 15th - Finally have the time to get to work and get started on this project.  Made sure every file was working properly and started working on the main code file.

Tuesday, Nov. 16th - After struggling for a while within visual studio code, I've moved over to Atom.  For some reason, visual studio code won't import PySimpleGUI, which is what I was hoping to make my user interface with.  Did find a workaround that worked on windows but not on Mac.

Wednesday, Nov. 17th - Mainly spent my time learning more about PySimpleGUI, figuring out how exactly I can use this as my framework for the project.

Thursday, Nov. 18th - Figured out the hard way that PySimpleGUI isn't really the way I need to go with this project, feeling sort of behind on the whole thing now.  Working with starting from scratch without that framework now. I've added a separate file called testingstuff.py to work with this new idea.  Also having trouble figuring out an idea to allow inputs from multiple players at once, so I'm going to focus on just one player's inputs and see if I can add more in later.

Friday, Nov. 19th - Making some good progress with the main code, figuring out how exactly I want the scores to be written and calculated.

Saturday, Nov. 20th - Working more on yahtzee logic, trying to figure out how to tell computer to read upperbonus and figured out a new way to make the ui easier to understand for inputing values on the scorecard.
