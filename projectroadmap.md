Project Roadmap

1. Make sure readme and project roadmap are working properly
2. Setup main code file
3. Import code from other projects involving the calculation of the yahtzee scores
3a. upper yahtzee scores, such as simple numbers, and upper bonus
3b. lower section scores, such as 3/4 of a kind, straights, chance, and yahtzee.
4. Create user interface to accept dice rolls from 1 or more players

[if i have time]
add functionality to include AI players as well as real players (might be just simulation dice rolls, might actually have time to create logic figuring out the best play given 3 rolls?)
